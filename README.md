# Harkirat - Basic Rust HTTP Server with Axum

This project is a minimal HTTP server built with [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) in Rust. It responds with `Hello, World!` at the root endpoint (`/`).

## Running the Server

1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.
2. Install dependencies and run the server:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```
3. Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser. You should see `Hello, World!`.
